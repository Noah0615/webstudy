<h2>Nomenclature</h2>
<p>Chicken can mean a chick, as in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, where Macduff laments the death of "all my pretty chickens and their dam".[16] The usage is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands.[17] In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts, chickens as a species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[19] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[20] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[19] Newly-hatched chicks of both modern and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a heritage chicken of the same age.[21]</p>

<p>According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[52] The red junglefowl is well adapted to take advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.[53] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of the red junglefowl's ability to reproduce prolifically when exposed to a surge in its food supply.[54]</p>
